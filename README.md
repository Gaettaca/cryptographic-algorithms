### Implementations of various cryptographic algorithms and methods for analyzing their characteristics.
1.  [Substitution cipher decoder](https://github.com/Gaettaca/cryptographic-algorithms/tree/main/hill-climbing-algo) based on a heuristic "hill climbing" algorithm.
2.  Simple [implementations](https://github.com/Gaettaca/cryptographic-algorithms/tree/main/hills-vigeners-ciphers) of the Vigenere cipher and the Hill cipher.
3. [Implementation](https://github.com/Gaettaca/cryptographic-algorithms/tree/main/g-model) of a model block cryptosystem by Feistel in different encryption modes.
4. [Implementation](https://github.com/Gaettaca/cryptographic-algorithms/tree/main/rsa-impl) of the RSA digital signature.
5. [Implementation](https://github.com/Gaettaca/cryptographic-algorithms/blob/main/attack-on-lfsr/generators.ipynb) of pseudorandom number generators. [Attack](https://github.com/Gaettaca/cryptographic-algorithms/tree/main/attack-on-lfsr) on a cipher text encrypted by LFSR generator.
